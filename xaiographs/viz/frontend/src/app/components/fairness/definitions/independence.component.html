    <label>We say that the random variables (Y, A) satisfy independence if the sensitive feature 'A' are statistically independent of the prediction 'Y'.</label>
    <label>That is, the probability of being classified by the model in each of the classes must be the same for two elements with different sensitive feature values (Demographic Parity).</label>
    <label class="example">The acceptance rate must be equal for each group (A=a, A=b)</label>
    <label>We define the independence score as:</label>
